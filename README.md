# TSCH

OMNeT++ simulation model for IEEE 802.15.4e Time Slotted Channel Hopping (TSCH)

## Compatibility

This model is developed and tested with the following library versions

*  OMNeT++ [5.5.1](https://omnetpp.org/software/2019/05/31/omnet-5-5-released.html)
*  OMNeT++ [5.6](https://omnetpp.org/software/2020/01/13/omnet-5-6-released.html)
*  INET [4.2](https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/releases/download/v4.2.0/inet-4.2.0-src.tgz)

**Known error in Windows with INET 4.2**: the commit [6ac2b9a](https://github.com/inet-framework/inet/commit/6ac2b9af073b308bf2ba58e3c4da50dd2e3e30b4) from the INET master branch has to be patched to INET 4.2 to avoid a compile error.
